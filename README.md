# GNU-Project

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a template for how prospective
developers structure their projects prior to submission. There is an ongoing
movement to automate as much of the project approval as possible and this
standardization would go a long way towards establishing an expectation 
through which this can more easily be carried out.

Just as importantly, the standardization of the project structure places the
necessary emphasis on the legal requirements that naturally result from 
developing free software. Unfortunately, developers new to this environment 
tend to not give things like the software licenses -and crucially their 
presence- the attention they deserve, and this is precisely one of the things
we hope to mitigate with this project.
