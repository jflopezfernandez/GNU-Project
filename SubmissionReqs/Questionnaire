            Questionnaire for offering software to GNU

* General Information
** Do you agree to follow GNU policies?
   If your program is accepted to be part of the GNU system, it means
   that you become a GNU maintainer, which in turn means that you will
   need to follow GNU policies in regards to that GNU program.
   (Summarized above, see maintainers document for full descriptions.)

** Package name and version:

** Author Full Name <Email>:

** URL to package home page (if any):

** URL to source tarball:
    Please make a release tarball for purposes of evaluation, whether
    or not you publicly release it.  If you don't have
    anywhere to upload it, send it as an attachment.

** Brief description of the package:


* Code
** Dependencies:
    Please list the package's dependencies (source language, libraries, etc.).

** Configuration, building, installation:
    It might or might not use Autoconf/Automake, but it must meet GNU
    standards.  Even packages that do not require compilation
    must follow these standards, so installers have a uniform way to
    define target directories, etc.  Please see:
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Configuration.html
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html

** Documentation:
    We require using Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/)
    for documentation, and recommend writing both reference and tutorial
    information in the same manual.  Please see
    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/GNU-Manuals.html

** Internationalization:
    If your package has any user-visible strings, please make them
    translatable to other languages using GNU Gettext:
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

** Accessibility:
    Please discuss any accessibility issues
    with your package, such as use of relevant APIs.

** Security:
    Please discuss any possible security issues with your package:
    cryptographic algorithms being used, sensitive data being stored,
    possible elevation of privileges, etc.

* Licensing:
   Both the software itself *and all dependencies* (third-party
   libraries, etc.) must be free software in order to be included in
   GNU.  In general, official GNU software should be released under the
   GNU GPL version 3 or any later version, and GNU documentation should
   be released under the GNU FDL version 1.3 or any later version.

   Please see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html for a
   practical guide to which licenses are free (for GNU's purposes) and
   which are not.  Please give specific url's to any licenses involved
   that are not listed on that page.


* Similar free software projects:
   Please explain what motivated you to write your package, and search
   at least the Free Software Directory (http://www.gnu.org/directory/)
   for projects similar to yours.  If any exist, please also explain
   what the principal differences are.
